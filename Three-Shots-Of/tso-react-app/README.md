# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# Three-Shots-Of

​

## Install instructions:

​

- Open the 'TSO' folder up through your terminal
  ​
- control + tilde to open terminal inside of VS Code
- Type 'Yarn install'
- Once installed type 'Yarn start' to load the app inside of your browser
  ​

## Technologies Used:

​

- React
  ​
  - create-react-app was used in order to create TSO - We brainstormed ideas about what we wanted our app to do, and how we wanted it to be shown in the browser - Brainstorm brainstorm notes:

    ​
  - We then split the pages between us to create
    ​
- Bulma
  - Bulma has been used for styling

## Lillian Hurdles:

​

- Overthinking the UI: I wanted the page to be as easy to use as possible, but also show all of the information necessary without having to go to 50 different places.
- I think that we ended up in a good place, as the 'Get Started' dropdown is intuitive, and the search bar on the 'Cocktails' page searches by full/partial cocktail name & cocktail containing the letter that is entered (if only a string of 1 or a few letters is entered)
- Getting the menu to show on the 'Cocktails' page. The logic was almost identical to 'Base', however, the list was just not showing up
- After bug fixing with Heng it was due the route extention needing to be added + missing props on one line
  ​

## Heng Hurdles:

​

- API responses aren't the best as they are not build to cather the needs of our app.
- Design of the website
