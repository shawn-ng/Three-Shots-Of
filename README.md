## Lillian Hurdles:

- Overthinking the UI: I wanted the page to be as easy to use as possible, but also show all of the information necessary without having to go to 50 different places.
- I think that we ended up in a good place, as the 'Get Started' dropdown is intuitive, and the search bar on the 'Cocktails' page searches by full/partial cocktail name & cocktail containing the letter that is entered (if only a string of 1 or a few letters is entered)
- Getting the menu to show on the 'Cocktails' page. The logic was almost identical to 'Base', however, the list was just not showing up
- After bug fixing with Heng it was due the route extention needing to be added + missing props on one line
  ​

## Heng Hurdles:

- API responses aren't the best as they are not build to cather the needs of our app.
- Design of the website
- Finding out what is the most agile way to work with partner ( git-branch )

## Future Developement:

- Deploy into actual website and allow access for users.
